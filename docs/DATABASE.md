# Cerno Database Documentation

Cerno uses an **integrated SQLite database** with a fully normalized schema for tracking scan metadata, review state, tool executions, and generated artifacts. The database provides an audit trail, enables historical analysis, cross-scan queries, and maintains referential integrity through foreign key constraints.

## Overview

The Cerno database tracks:

- **Scans**: Nessus export metadata (scan name, export root, .nessus file hash)
- **Plugins**: Vulnerability definitions (plugin ID, name, severity, CVSS scores, CVEs, Metasploit modules)
- **Findings**: Individual vulnerability findings per scan (review state, reviewed timestamp)
- **Hosts & Ports**: Normalized host/port data with cross-scan tracking
- **Sessions**: Review session state (start time, duration via SQL view)
- **Tool Executions**: Commands run during reviews (tool name, exit codes, duration)
- **Artifacts**: Generated files from tool runs (file paths, SHA256 hashes, sizes)
- **Workflows**: Custom workflow execution tracking

All operations work **transparently** - no manual database management required.

---

## Database Location

**Default Path**: `~/.cerno/cerno.db`

The database is global across all scans, enabling cross-scan queries and historical analysis.

**Directory**: `~/.cerno/` is created automatically on first use.

**Schema Version**: 1 (single-version, normalized structure - no migration system)

---

## Normalized Schema Architecture

Cerno uses a **fully normalized database schema** following relational best practices.

### Key Design Principles

1. **Normalized Lookup Tables**
   - `severity_levels` - Centralized severity reference data
   - `artifact_types` - Standardized artifact type definitions
   - `hosts` - Deduplicated host data across scans
   - `ports` - Port metadata

2. **Computed Values via Views**
   - Host/port counts computed on-demand via SQL views
   - Session statistics aggregated dynamically
   - No cached or redundant data stored in columns

3. **SQL Views for Statistics**
   - `v_finding_stats` - Host/port counts per finding
   - `v_session_stats` - Session duration and file counts
   - `v_plugins_with_severity` - Plugins with severity labels
   - `v_host_findings` - Cross-scan host analysis
   - `v_artifacts_with_types` - Artifacts with type names
   - `v_scan_plugin_summary` - Plugin presence per scan with host counts (cross-scan comparison)
   - `v_host_scan_findings` - Per-host vulnerability statistics by scan (host history)

4. **Foreign Key Constraints Throughout**
   - All relationships enforced at database level
   - Cascade deletes where appropriate
   - Referential integrity guaranteed

### Benefits

- **Zero Data Redundancy**: Single source of truth for all data
- **Always Accurate**: Computed values never stale
- **Cross-Scan Queries**: Track hosts across multiple scans
- **Data Integrity**: Foreign keys prevent orphaned records
- **Better Performance**: Optimized indexes on all foreign keys

---

## Schema Overview

The database consists of **13 tables** and **7 views**:

### Foundation Tables (Normalized Reference Data)

1. **severity_levels** - Severity definitions (0-4, labels, colors)
2. **artifact_types** - Artifact type definitions
3. **audit_log** - Change tracking for critical tables

### Core Tables

4. **scans** - Top-level scan tracking
5. **plugins** - Plugin metadata (Nessus plugin ID, severity, CVEs)
6. **findings** - Vulnerability findings per scan (review state)
7. **hosts** - Normalized host data (cross-scan tracking)
8. **ports** - Port metadata
9. **finding_affected_hosts** - Host:port combinations per finding (normalized FKs)

### Review & Execution Tracking

10. **sessions** - Review session tracking
11. **tool_executions** - Commands run during reviews
12. **artifacts** - Generated output files
13. **workflow_executions** - Custom workflow tracking

    v.scan_count,
    v.finding_count
FROM hosts h
JOIN v_host_findings v ON h.host_id = v.host_id
ORDER BY days_tracked DESC;
```

---

### Compare Host Findings Between Two Scans

```sql
SELECT
    h.ip_address,
    h.scan_target,
    s1_findings.plugin_count as scan1_plugins,
    s2_findings.plugin_count as scan2_plugins,
    CASE
        WHEN s1_findings.plugin_count > s2_findings.plugin_count THEN 'Improved'
        WHEN s1_findings.plugin_count < s2_findings.plugin_count THEN 'Worsened'
        ELSE 'Same'
    END as trend

### Find New Hosts in Latest Scan

```sql
-- Hosts that appear in latest scan but not in previous scans
SELECT
    h.ip_address,
    h.scan_target,
    h.scan_target_type,
    h.netbios_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT f.plugin_id) as finding_count,
    MAX(p.severity_int) as max_severity
FROM hosts h
JOIN finding_affected_hosts fah ON h.host_id = fah.host_id
JOIN findings f ON fah.finding_id = f.finding_id
JOIN plugins p ON f.plugin_id = p.plugin_id
WHERE f.scan_id = (SELECT scan_id FROM scans ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1)
  AND h.host_id NOT IN (
      SELECT DISTINCT fah2.host_id
      FROM finding_affected_hosts fah2
      JOIN findings f2 ON fah2.finding_id = f2.finding_id
      WHERE f2.scan_id != (SELECT scan_id FROM scans ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1)
  )
GROUP BY h.host_id, h.ip_address, h.scan_target, h.scan_target_type, h.netbios_name
ORDER BY max_severity DESC, finding_count DESC;

## Schema Reference

Full schema available in [`../schema.sql`](../schema.sql).

### Database Initialization

The database is initialized automatically on first use. Schema creation is handled by `cerno_pkg/database.py:initialize_database()`.

**Key Points**:
- Schema version: 1 (single-version, no migration system)
- All tables created with `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for idempotency
- Foundation tables pre-populated automatically
- Views created after tables
- Foreign key constraints enforced on all connections

### PRAGMA Settings

Applied at connection time for optimal performance:

```sql
PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;        -- Write-Ahead Logging for concurrency
PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON;         -- Enable referential integrity
PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL;      -- Balance safety and performance
PRAGMA temp_store=MEMORY;       -- Keep temp tables in memory
PRAGMA cache_size=-64000;       -- 64MB cache
```

### Foreign Key Relationships

```
scans
  ├── findings (scan_id) - CASCADE DELETE
  └── sessions (scan_id) - CASCADE DELETE

plugins
  └── findings (plugin_id) - RESTRICT DELETE

severity_levels
  └── plugins (severity_int) - RESTRICT DELETE

hosts
  └── finding_affected_hosts (host_id) - RESTRICT DELETE

ports
  └── finding_affected_hosts (port_number) - RESTRICT DELETE

findings
  ├── finding_affected_hosts (finding_id) - CASCADE DELETE
  ├── tool_executions (finding_id) - SET NULL DELETE
  └── workflow_executions (finding_id) - CASCADE DELETE

sessions
  └── tool_executions (session_id) - SET NULL DELETE

tool_executions
  └── artifacts (execution_id) - SET NULL DELETE

artifact_types
  └── artifacts (artifact_type_id) - RESTRICT DELETE
```

**Cascade Rules**:
- Deleting a scan removes all findings, sessions, and dependent review records
- Deleting a finding removes all finding_affected_hosts and workflow_executions
- Deleting a finding or session sets matching tool execution foreign keys to NULL, preserving execution history
- Deleting a tool_execution sets artifact foreign keys to NULL, preserving artifact records
- Cannot delete severity_levels, hosts, ports, or artifact_types if referenced

## Database Maintenance

### Direct Database Access

```bash
# Open database in sqlite3 CLI
sqlite3 ~/.cerno/cerno.db

# Run a query
sqlite3 ~/.cerno/cerno.db "SELECT * FROM v_host_findings LIMIT 10;"

# Export to CSV
sqlite3 -csv ~/.cerno/cerno.db "SELECT * FROM v_session_stats;" > sessions.csv
```

### Health Checks

```bash
# Check database integrity
sqlite3 ~/.cerno/cerno.db "PRAGMA integrity_check;"

# Optimize database (reclaim space)
sqlite3 ~/.cerno/cerno.db "VACUUM;"

# Database statistics
sqlite3 ~/.cerno/cerno.db "
  SELECT
    (page_count * page_size) / 1024.0 / 1024.0 as size_mb
  FROM (
    SELECT (SELECT * FROM pragma_page_count) as page_count,
           (SELECT * FROM pragma_page_size) as page_size
  );
"
```

### Backup Database

```bash
# Simple copy
cp ~/.cerno/cerno.db ~/.cerno/cerno.db.backup

# SQLite backup command (safer during active use)
sqlite3 ~/.cerno/cerno.db ".backup ~/.cerno/cerno.db.backup"
```

## Future Enhancements

Planned database features:

- **Enhanced cross-scan analytics**: Trend analysis, risk scoring over time
- **Reverse DNS resolution**: Automatically populate `hosts.reverse_dns`
- **Port service detection**: Populate `ports.service_name` from nmap results
- **Audit triggers**: Automatically track changes to critical tables
- **Export utilities**: Generate reports from database queries
- **Web UI**: Database-backed web interface for team collaboration
