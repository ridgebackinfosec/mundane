## About the Name

**Cerno** comes from the Latin verb *cernō*, meaning:
- To discern, distinguish, perceive
- To separate, sift through
- To decide, determine, resolve

The name reflects this tool's core purpose: **to help security professionals discern what matters** in large vulnerability scans. Just as *cernō* means to sift through and distinguish the important from the noise, Cerno helps you:

- **Discern** which findings require immediate action vs. can be deferred
- **Separate** findings by severity, host, and exploitability
- **Perceive** patterns across hosts and identify verification paths
- **Determine** the most efficient approach to vulnerability validation
- **Resolve** findings through organized, tracked remediation workflows

In penetration testing and vulnerability management, clarity through careful examination is essential—that's Cerno.


**Pronunciation:** In Classical Latin, *cerno* is pronounced **KEHR-noh** (IPA: [ˈkɛr.noː])—the 'c' as a hard 'k' sound, the 'e' as in 'bed', and the 'o' as in 'no' (long). [Audio sample](https://www.howtopronounce.com/latin/cerno)

## Installation

**Requirements:** Python 3.11+ on Linux, macOS, or Windows.

**Recommended (pipx):**
```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/ridgebackinfosec/cerno.git
cerno --help
```

**Alternative (pip):**
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/ridgebackinfosec/cerno.git
```

**Development:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ridgebackinfosec/cerno.git
cd cerno
pip install -e .
```

**Shell completion:**
```bash
cerno --install-completion  # Enable tab completion for your shell
```

---

## Releases

Cerno uses **automated releases** triggered by version changes in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml).

**How it works:**
- When `pyproject.toml` version is updated and merged to `main`, GitHub Actions automatically:
  - Creates a git tag (e.g., `v1.0.1`)
  - Generates a GitHub Release marked as "latest"
  - Extracts release notes from [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
  - Attaches built wheel and source distribution

**View releases:** [github.com/ridgebackinfosec/cerno/releases](https://github.com/ridgebackinfosec/cerno/releases)

**For contributors:** To create a new release, update the version in `pyproject.toml` and add an entry to `CHANGELOG.md` following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format. The release workflow runs automatically when changes are merged to `main`.

---

## Requirements

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Optional tools:** `nmap`, `nxc`/`netexec`, `msfconsole`, `claude` (only if you use them)
- **Linux recommended** (clipboard tools: `xclip`, `xsel`, or `wl-copy`)

---

## Configuration

**Configuration file** (`~/.cerno/config.yaml`):

Auto-created with defaults on first run. All settings managed via config file.

```bash
cerno config show                    # View all settings with current values
cerno config get <key>               # Get a single config value
cerno config set <key> <value>       # Change a setting
cerno config reset                   # Reset to defaults (creates backup)
```

**Proxychains4 proxy settings:**
```bash
cerno config set proxychains_enabled true        # Enable proxy routing (default: false)
cerno config set proxychains_host 127.0.0.1      # SOCKS5 proxy host
cerno config set proxychains_port 9000           # SOCKS5 proxy port (matches ssh -D default)
```

### 🤖 Claude Assistant (BETA)

Ask Claude questions about findings without leaving the TUI. Powered by the `claude` CLI (`claude -p`) — no API key required, no data sent to external services beyond what `claude` itself handles.

**Three scopes:**
- **Finding level** — press `[A]` inside a finding detail view to discuss that specific plugin: CVEs, CVSS context, exploitability, verification steps
- **Severity menu** — press `[A]` at the severity selection screen to discuss all findings across the selected scan(s)
- **Findings list** — press `[A]` in the findings list footer to discuss the current set of findings (respects any active severity, name, or group filter)

**Conversation persistence:** History is saved per-scope in SQLite and resumed automatically on re-entry. Press `C` inside the chat to clear history for the current scope.

**Setup:**
```bash
# Install Claude Code CLI and authenticate (required)
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code   # or follow https://claude.ai/code
claude  # launches interactive setup — complete login before using this feature

# Disable if not wanted
cerno config set claude_assistant_enabled false
```

**Tool availability:** `[A]` is hidden when `claude` is not on PATH, you are not logged into Claude Code, or `claude_assistant_enabled` is `false`. It appears in the tool availability table on review startup alongside nmap/netexec/msfconsole.

> **Note:** This feature is in beta and requires an active Claude Code session on your machine. Responses may be inaccurate — always verify before acting on suggestions.

---

### 🔗 NetExec Database Integration (Beta)

Automatically enrich finding displays with data from your NetExec databases—see which credentials work on affected hosts, share access, and security misconfigurations.

**Features:**
- **Credential correlation** - Shows which NetExec-discovered credentials have access to affected hosts
- **Share access** - Displays SMB share read/write permissions across hosts
- **Security flags** - Highlights SMB signing disabled, Zerologon, PetitPotam vulnerabilities
- **Per-host breakdown** - Press `[N]` in finding view for detailed per-host NetExec context

**Configuration:**
```bash
# NetExec workspace auto-detected at ~/.nxc/workspaces/default/
cerno config set nxc_workspace_path ~/.nxc/workspaces/client_a  # Custom workspace
cerno config set nxc_enrichment_enabled false                    # Disable feature
```

**Supported protocols:** SMB, SSH, LDAP, MSSQL, RDP, WinRM, FTP, NFS, VNC, WMI

> **Note:** This feature is in beta. NetExec databases are read in read-only mode; Cerno never modifies them.

---

### ⚡ One-command tool launches

Launch nmap NSE scripts, NetExec, Metasploit, or custom commands with placeholder substitution.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/tool-orchestration.png" alt="Tool selection and command generation" width="70%">
  <br>
  <em>Select tools and review generated commands before execution</em>
</p>

**Features:**
- Launch **nmap** (NSE profiles, UDP), **NetExec**, or custom commands
- Placeholder substitution for flexible templating
- Execution logging & artifact tracking

---

### 💾 SQLite-backed persistence

**Session Management:**
- Auto-save/resume interrupted reviews
- Reversible review-complete (undo with `[U]`)
- Session statistics (duration, per-severity breakdown)

**Database:** SQLite-backed persistence at `~/.cerno/cerno.db` tracks scans, findings, sessions, tool executions, and artifacts. Cross-scan tracking enables host history queries. See [docs/DATABASE.md](docs/DATABASE.md) for schema details.

---

### 🔀 Proxychains4 Integration

Route all tool executions (nmap, NetExec, Metasploit, custom commands) through a SOCKS5 proxy via `proxychains4`. Designed for use with an SSH `-D` tunnel.

**Enable in config (persists across sessions):**
```bash
cerno config set proxychains_enabled true
cerno config set proxychains_host 127.0.0.1
cerno config set proxychains_port 9000           # Matches: ssh -D 9000 user@host
```

**Or override per session:**
```bash
cerno review --proxy      # Force-enable for this session
cerno review --no-proxy   # Force-disable for this session
```

**Behavior when active:**
- `[PROXY]` badge (magenta) shown in the review session status line
- proxychains4 row appears in the startup tool availability table
- nmap automatically adds `-Pn` and drops `sudo` when proxied (ICMP and raw sockets don't traverse SOCKS)
- Cerno manages its own `~/.cerno/proxychains4.conf` — system config is not touched

> **Requires:** `proxychains4` installed and available on PATH.
