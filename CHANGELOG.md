# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.3.41] - 2026-06-10

### Added
- Added `cerno demo` to prepare bundled synthetic demo data, importing initial and expanded Nessus scans and configuring the included NetExec workspace for review demos.
- Added synthetic demo Nessus fixtures and NetExec workspace databases for cloned-repo and packaged installs, including `pipx` installs.

### Fixed
- Re-importing or overwriting a scan with the same name now refreshes scan metadata and replaces scan-derived findings/host services cleanly instead of silently failing on duplicate finding rows.
- Nessus imports now preserve bare IPv6 scan targets instead of misparsing the final IPv6 segment as a port.
- Nmap proxy mode now suppresses UDP scanning and uses TCP targets so generated proxychains commands match the UI warning that UDP is unsupported through SOCKS.
- Clipboard copy fallback now tries every available platform tool before reporting failure, so one broken backend no longer blocks later working backends.
- Scan deletion wording now accurately states that tool execution and artifact history is retained with deleted links cleared.

## [1.3.40] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- Workflow verification context now included in per-finding Claude assistant conversations (if available from workflow mappings) — displays workflow name, description, steps with commands/notes, and references (`cerno_pkg/claude_assistant.py:build_finding_context()`)

## [1.3.39] - 2026-04-23

### Changed
- Claude assistant exit changed from `Q` to `Ctrl+C` (`tui.py`, `cerno.py`)
- Claude assistant history clear changed from `C` to `/clear` command (`cerno.py`, `render.py`)

## [1.3.38] - 2026-04-23

### Changed
- Claude assistant controls hint keys styled cyan to match Cerno UI conventions (`render.py:render_claude_panel()`)

## [1.3.37] - 2026-04-23

### Changed
- Claude assistant controls hint updated to accurately reflect multi-line input: `[Enter] new line  [Alt+Enter] submit  [C] clear history  [Q] back` (`render.py:render_claude_panel()`)

## [1.3.36] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- Restored `handle_finding_list_actions` logic truncated by misplaced `ask_claude_multiline` definition — finding selection returned `None`, causing `TypeError: cannot unpack non-iterable NoneType object` (`cerno_pkg/tui.py`)

## [1.3.35] - 2026-04-22

### Changed
- Claude assistant prompt now supports multi-line input; `Enter` inserts a newline, `Ctrl+Enter` submits (`cerno.py`, `cerno_pkg/tui.py`)
- Added `prompt_toolkit>=3.0` dependency to support multi-line input

## [1.3.34] - 2026-04-22

### Changed
- Claude assistant panel replaced the Rich bordered Panel with a "soft panel": thick magenta Rules (`━`) at top and bottom, content printed line-by-line with `soft_wrap=True` — terminal handles visual wrapping so Ctrl+Shift+C copy-paste to Word produces no spurious newlines (`render.py:render_claude_panel()`)

## [1.3.33] - 2026-04-21

### Changed
- Claude assistant panel now uses plain `cyan`/`magenta` labels and unstyled body text; removes brightness-based contrast (dim/white) that was unreadable on light terminals (`render.py:_build_claude_panel_renderables()`)
- Removed duplicate "Ask Claude:" prompt from inside the panel — input prompt from `Prompt.ask()` below the panel is sufficient

## [1.3.32] - 2026-04-21

### Changed
- `render_claude_panel()` in `render.py` now renders conversation history inside a Rich bordered Panel with `bold magenta` border; prior exchanges are dimmed and the latest user+assistant exchange renders at full brightness; Rule separators appear between exchanges
- Claude Assistant waiting spinner upgraded from `_console_global.status()` to `Progress` with `SpinnerColumn` + `TimeElapsedColumn` in `browse_claude_chat()` and `browse_claude_chat_aggregate()` (`cerno.py`); spinner appears below the panel and disappears when the response arrives

## [1.3.31] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- `[E] CVEs (N)` in findings list footer was showing the filtered finding count instead of unique CVE count (`cerno.py`, `render.py:render_actions_footer()`)

### Added
- `[V] View hosts (N)` in findings list footer now shows unique host count across all filtered findings (`cerno.py`, `render.py:render_actions_footer()`)

## [1.3.30] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- `ImportError: cannot import name 'copy_to_clipboard' from 'cerno_pkg.render'` in `[V]` host view — moved import to `cerno_pkg.tools` (`cerno.py`)

## [1.3.29] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- `AttributeError: 'Finding' object has no attribute 'host_count'` when sending a message to Claude from the findings selection menu (`claude_assistant.py:build_aggregate_context()`)

### Changed
- `[V]` host view in findings list now matches single-finding host view UX: grouped format by default, Copy/Change format/Back post-view menu, Raw/Hosts-only/Grouped format options with clipboard support

## [1.3.28] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- `[V]` action in findings list shows a deduplicated host→ports view across all current candidates (respects severity, name, and group filters)

### Changed
- Aggregate Claude context trimmed to a concise signal-only format: numbered one-line-per-finding entries with severity, host count, CVEs, and MSF flag — raw host:port lists and pre-computed group analysis removed
- Skill prompt updated with `[H]`/`[O]`/`[V]` guidance so Claude redirects host-overlap questions to the appropriate actions

## [1.3.27] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- Aggregate Claude context now includes per-finding host:port lists (capped at 20 entries each) and pre-computed identical/overlapping host:port group analysis, enabling Claude to answer H/O-style questions conversationally (`claude_assistant.py:build_aggregate_context()`)

## [1.3.26] - 2026-04-21

### Changed
- Claude Assistant responses now render with `soft_wrap=True` so terminal-selected text copies without spurious newlines (`render.py:render_claude_panel()`)

## [1.3.25] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- `tui.py`: Remove redundant confirmation prompt when bulk-marking findings as review complete — one confirmation now instead of two

## [1.3.24] - 2026-04-21

### Changed
- `workflow_mappings.yaml`: Renamed "Deprecated SSL/TLS Encryption" workflow to "Weak SSL/TLS Configurations"; added 9 plugins (26928, 31705, 42873, 65821, 78479, 81606, 83738, 83875, 89058) bringing total to 12; updated description and notes to cover weak/anonymous/export cipher suites and specific vulnerabilities (POODLE, FREAK, Logjam) in addition to deprecated protocol versions

## [1.3.23] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- `workflow_mappings.yaml`: New "SSH Service Verification" workflow grouping plugins 90317 (password auth accepted), 70658 (CBC ciphers enabled), 153953 (weak KEX algorithms), and 71049 (weak MACs) — steps cover nmap with `ssh2-enum-algos,ssh-hostkey,sshv1,ssh-auth-methods`, ssh-audit, password auth verification, and Metasploit user enumeration

## [1.3.22] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- `render.py`: Remove leading spaces from CVEs in separated-by-finding bulk CVE list output

## [1.3.21] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- `render.py`: Remove leading spaces from CVEs in combined bulk CVE list for clean copy/paste into reports

## [1.3.20] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- `claude_assistant.py`: `TypeError` when Claude subprocess times out — `log_error()` was called with two positional args but only accepts one; fixed to use f-string interpolation
- `claude_assistant.py`: Increased default `ask_claude()` timeout from 30s to 120s to prevent premature `TimeoutExpired` errors on slow Claude responses

## [1.3.19] - 2026-04-17

### Changed
- Report Brief Mode in `cerno-assistant.md`: ports for the same host are now grouped on a single line, comma-separated (e.g. `192.168.56.4:80,443,8080`) rather than one line per host:port combination
- Report Brief Mode in `cerno-assistant.md`: single-host findings now name the host inline in the prose rather than listing it below

## [1.3.18] - 2026-04-17

### Changed
- Report Brief Mode in `cerno-assistant.md`: removed Nessus severity rating from output (analyst determines severity independently); replaced inline host list with a plain line-per-host block after the prose ("across the N systems below"), or "across X systems (listed in Appendix C)" for 100+ hosts; hosts output with no leading dash to avoid Word bullet formatting conflicts

## [1.3.17] - 2026-04-16

### Changed
- Claude Assistant per-finding context now includes Nessus plugin output (raw scanner text per host) so Claude can reference specific version strings, banners, and paths from the scan; capped at 5 hosts × 600 chars each with truncation notice (`claude_assistant.py:build_finding_context`, `run_exchange`)

## [1.3.16] - 2026-04-16

### Changed
- Remote scan server status message updated from "HTTP server running" to "HTTPS server running" for clarity (`tools.py`)
- Remote scan server status message updated from "serving IP list" to "serving target list" (`tools.py`)
- Served target file URL path renamed from `/ips.txt` to `/targets.txt` in HTTPS server and curl one-liner (`ops.py`)
- Proxy indicator badge renamed from `[PROXY]` to `[PROXY ENABLED]` in review session status line and finding action footer (`cerno.py`, `render.py`)

### Fixed
- Remote scan UDP mode: `build_nmap_remote_oneliner()` now accepts a `udp` parameter and emits `-sU` instead of hardcoded `-sS` when a UDP scan is requested; caller in `tools.py` passes `udp=bool(udp_ports)` (`ops.py`, `tools.py`)
- Claude Assistant report brief trigger word changed from `summarize`/`scenario` to `report`; removed the unverified-finding caveat from both the system prompt and the injected query (`claude_assistant.py`, `cerno-assistant.md`)

## [1.3.15] - 2026-04-16

### Changed
- Remote scan mode server upgraded from HTTP to HTTPS: self-signed certificate generated at startup via `openssl req`, server socket wrapped with `ssl.SSLContext` (TLS 1.2+ enforced), server now binds to the configured `pivot_interface` IP only instead of `0.0.0.0` — limiting exposure to other networks (`ops.py`, `start_ips_server`)
- Remote scan curl one-liner updated to `curl -sk https://` to match the HTTPS server; `-k` skips self-signed cert verification on the pivot (`ops.py`, `build_nmap_remote_oneliner`)

## [1.3.14] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- Claude Assistant: typing `summarize` or `scenario` in the chat prompt now generates a past-tense pentest report brief for the current finding or scope — mentions affected systems/ports, severity, any mapped Metasploit modules, and flags the finding as unverified (`claude_assistant.py`, `cerno.py`, `cerno_pkg/skills/cerno-assistant.md`)

## [1.3.13] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- Remote scan mode HTTP server now fully releases its port after shutdown — `server.server_close()` is called alongside `server.shutdown()`, and `allow_reuse_address = True` is set so the port is immediately reclaimable; previously the socket remained bound, causing `Address already in use` on the second remote command invocation (`ops.py`, `tools.py`)
- `pivot_interface` and `pivot_http_port` now appear in `cerno config show` output (`cerno.py`)

## [1.3.12] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- `build_nmap_remote_oneliner` function was written to `ops.py` during v1.3.11 implementation but never committed — caused `ImportError` on `pipx upgrade cerno` since `tools.py` imported it but the installed package lacked the definition

## [1.3.11] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- Remote Scan Mode for nmap: `[R] Toggle Remote Mode` in the nmap options menu hosts the target list via a temporary HTTP server and generates a `curl | sudo nmap -sS` one-liner for the operator to run directly on a pivot host — enabling full SYN scans without proxychains constraints (`tools.py`, `ops.py`)
- Interface picker: on first remote mode activation with no `pivot_interface` configured, prompts user to select from detected network interfaces and saves the choice to `~/.cerno/config.yaml` automatically (`tools.py`)
- `get_interface_ip(interface)` and `list_interfaces()` utilities in `ops.py` for detecting IPv4 address from a named network interface using `fcntl`/`socket`
- `start_ips_server(ips_path, port)` in `ops.py`: minimal HTTP server serving only `GET /ips.txt` — no directory listing, 404 for all other paths, request logging suppressed
- `build_nmap_remote_oneliner()` in `ops.py`: constructs the `curl -s http://<ip>:<port>/ips.txt | sudo nmap -sS -A -iL -` one-liner with optional port and NSE flags; no `-Pn` (not needed without proxychains)
- `pivot_interface` (default: `null`) and `pivot_http_port` (default: `8877`) config fields (`config.py`)
- `CommandResult.is_remote`, `CommandResult.cleanup`, `CommandResult.remote_output_path` fields for display-only remote workflow results that cerno shows but does not execute (`tool_context.py`)
- Post-scan guidance: after the operator dismisses the remote command screen, cerno prints `scp` and `cerno import nmap` commands to retrieve and import results

## [1.3.10] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- Claude Assistant now correctly reports Metasploit module names for findings with mapped MSF modules — `metasploit_names` was not included in the `get_by_scan_with_plugin` and `get_by_scan_ids_merged` SELECT queries, so `Plugin` objects always had `metasploit_names=None` and the context block always showed "Metasploit Modules: None" even when `has_metasploit=True` (`models.py`)

## [1.3.9] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- `[PROXY]` badge now appears in finding action footer (`render_finding_actions_footer`) when focused on a specific finding — previously only shown in the findings list menu
- `[PROXY]` badge now appears in the Execution Summary panel (`command_review_menu`) as "Proxy: proxychains4 ACTIVE" before confirming tool execution — previously invisible at command preview step

## [1.3.8] - 2026-04-15

### Changed
- Trimmed CLAUDE.md by 29% (279 lines) — removed generic Python principles, verbose packaging examples, release workflow internals, and test pattern boilerplate to improve Claude Code context efficiency

## [1.3.7] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- proxychains4 integration: route all tool executions (nmap, netexec, Metasploit, custom) through a SOCKS5 proxy via proxychains4
  - New config fields: `proxychains_enabled` (default: false), `proxychains_host` (default: 127.0.0.1), `proxychains_port` (default: 9000)
  - Cerno manages its own `~/.cerno/proxychains4.conf` — system config is not touched
  - `--proxy` / `--no-proxy` flags on `cerno review` to override config per session
  - nmap proxy adjustments: `-Pn` added automatically, sudo dropped, limitations note shown
  - `[PROXY]` badge (magenta) in review session status line when proxy is active
  - proxychains4 row in startup tool availability table with active/inactive state

### Documentation
- README: added proxychains4 integration section under Features
- README: Commands section updated with `cerno import nessus <directory>`, `cerno review --proxy/--no-proxy/--check`, `cerno scan compare`, `cerno scan history`, `cerno reset`, and `cerno config get`
- README: Keyboard Shortcuts expanded from 9 to 25 shortcuts, split into findings-list view and finding-detail view contexts
- README: Configuration section updated with proxychains4 config keys and `cerno config get`
- README: Troubleshooting section updated with `cerno reset` as full environment reset option

## [1.3.6] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- Fixed "Getting Started" and "Tips" panels showing single-scan statistics when reviewing multiple scans simultaneously (`onboarding.py:show_workflow_guidance()`, `onboarding.py:_show_context_aware_tips()`)
- Fixed `scan.scan_name` variable reference bug at the `show_workflow_guidance()` call site (`cerno.py`) — now correctly uses `selected_scan.scan_name`

## [1.3.5] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- `cerno import nessus` now accepts a directory path; recursively discovers `.nessus` files, lists staged imports with file sizes, and prompts for confirmation before importing each in sequence with progress tracking and a final summary

## [1.3.4] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- `cerno reset` command to purge `~/.cerno` and return to a fresh installation state, with type-to-confirm safety prompt

## [1.3.3] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- Bundled `cerno_pkg/skills/cerno-assistant.md` skill prompt ships with the package — Claude Assistant now works out of the box after `pipx install`

### Changed
- `load_skill_prompt()` in `claude_assistant.py` now reads the bundled skill only, with inline fallback if the file is missing (previously only checked the gitignored repo-root path, so `pipx` installs always fell back to the minimal inline prompt)
- `pyproject.toml` package-data updated to include `skills/*.md` so the skill file is included in the wheel

## [1.3.2] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- Claude Assistant aggregate chat at severity selection menu (`[A]` key): discuss all findings across selected scan(s); context includes severity breakdown, review state, MSF/CVE summary, and up to 50 findings (highest severity first)
- Claude Assistant aggregate chat at findings list (`[A]` key in action footer): discuss the current findings in scope (filtered by severity, name filter, or group filter); context adapts to whatever filter is active
- `browse_claude_chat_aggregate()` in `cerno.py` — shared chat loop for both aggregate entry points
- `build_aggregate_context()` and `run_aggregate_exchange()` in `cerno_pkg/claude_assistant.py`
- `ClaudeAggregateConversationTurn` model in `cerno_pkg/models.py` — conversation persistence keyed by `context_key` string
- `claude_aggregate_conversations` table in SQLite schema (`cerno_pkg/database.py`) with index on `context_key`

### Changed
- Documentation updates: README and CLAUDE.md updated for Claude Assistant feature (all three scopes, keyboard shortcuts, config option, requirements)

## [1.3.1] - 2026-04-07

### Changed
- Tool availability table now includes `claude (assistant)` row showing Claude Code CLI install status and version (`render.py:render_tool_availability_table()`)

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- Claude Assistant (BETA): interactive AI chat panel for findings, opened with `[A]` in the review TUI
  - On-demand overlay panel powered by `claude -p` (Claude Code CLI); no API key required
  - Persistent per-finding conversation history stored in SQLite (`claude_conversations` table, FK to `findings` with CASCADE delete)
  - Structured finding context injected automatically into every prompt (plugin name/ID, severity, CVSS, CVEs, MSF modules, affected hosts, review state, multi-scan note)
  - Gated on `claude` CLI availability (same pattern as nmap/netexec/msfconsole checks); `[A]` shown grayed out when claude is installed but assistant is disabled
  - Custom skill file (`.claude/skills/cerno-assistant.md`) used as system prompt for all exchanges
  - Config toggle: `claude_assistant_enabled` (default: `true`); disable with `cerno config set claude_assistant_enabled false`
  - `✦` (magenta) indicator in findings list for findings with existing conversation history; column only shown when history exists (no visual noise on fresh scans)
  - BETA notice shown once per panel open; "resumed · N exchanges · Xh ago" header on re-open
  - `[C]` to clear history, `[Esc/Q]` to return to finding review
- New module `cerno_pkg/claude_assistant.py`: availability check, context builder, prompt formatter, subprocess caller, exchange orchestrator
- `ClaudeConversationTurn` model (`models.py`): dataclass + `get_by_finding()`, `add()`, `clear()`, `finding_has_history()` class methods
- `render_claude_panel()` in `render.py`: chat overlay with dimmed history, input prompt, and controls hint
- `claude_assistant_enabled` config field in `CernoConfig` (default: `True`)

## [1.2.31] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- Finding host counts, affected hosts, plugin output, and view formats now aggregate across all selected scans in multi-scan review mode (`cerno_pkg/models.py`, `cerno.py`)
  - Added transient `extra_finding_ids: list[int]` field to `Finding` dataclass; set by `browse_file_list` before opening a finding so all downstream queries cover every selected scan
  - `get_hosts_and_ports()`, `get_all_host_port_lines()`, `get_port_distribution()`, and `get_plugin_outputs_by_host()` now expand `WHERE finding_id = ?` to `WHERE finding_id IN (...)` using `extra_finding_ids` when populated; DISTINCT ensures no duplicate host/port rows
  - `get_counts_for()` in `browse_file_list` now queries `COUNT(DISTINCT host_id)` across all finding_ids from `all_instances` in multi-scan mode, fixing host counts in the findings list table
- Session statistics severity breakdown now aggregates across all selected scans in multi-scan mode using `COUNT(DISTINCT plugin_id)` (`cerno.py:show_session_statistics()`)

## [1.2.30] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- Workflow findings sub-level breadcrumb now reflects all selected scans in multi-scan mode (`cerno.py:browse_workflow_groups()`)
  - `browse_workflow_groups()` accepts new `scans` param (full list of selected scans); passes it to `browse_file_list()` so the inner findings view uses multi-scan mode and shows the correct breadcrumb
  - Post-review workflow refresh query now uses `Finding.get_by_scan_ids_merged()` for multi-scan instead of single-scan `get_by_scan_with_plugin()`

## [1.2.29] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- Findings list and workflow group breadcrumbs now reflect all selected scans in multi-scan review mode (`cerno.py`)
  - `browse_file_list()` breadcrumb shows "ScanA + ScanB" or "N scans" instead of only the primary scan name
  - `browse_workflow_groups()` accepts new `scan_label` param and uses it in the breadcrumb when provided; call site passes `_scan_label` built from all selected scans

## [1.2.28] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- Scan Overview now reflects all selected scans in multi-scan review mode; previously only the primary scan's hosts, ports, and finding counts were shown (`cerno_pkg/session.py:show_scan_summary()`)
  - Host/port queries use `IN (scan_ids)` for multi-scan; empty-findings count deduplicates by `plugin_id`
  - Finding counts use `COUNT(DISTINCT plugin_id)` across all selected scans via `Finding.count_by_scan()` and `count_reviewed_in_scan()`
  - Header displays all scan names (e.g. "Scan Overview — ScanA + ScanB" or comma-separated for 3+)
- Severity selection breadcrumb/header now shows all selected scan names instead of only the primary scan (e.g. "ScanA + ScanB > Choose severity" or "3 scans > Choose severity") (`cerno.py`)

## [1.2.27] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- Severity menu now correctly aggregates findings across all selected scans in multi-scan review mode; previously only the primary (first) scan's findings were counted and displayed (`cerno.py`, `cerno_pkg/models.py`, `cerno_pkg/render.py`)
  - `Finding.get_severity_dirs_for_scan()` and `Finding.count_by_scan_severity()` accept new `scan_ids` param; multi-scan uses `IN (...)` clause and `COUNT(DISTINCT plugin_id)` for accurate deduplication
  - MSF and Workflow Mapped virtual groups now use `Finding.get_by_scan_ids_merged()` for multi-scan count queries
  - `render_severity_table()` and `count_severity_findings()` thread `scan_ids` through to model layer

## [1.2.26] - 2026-03-31

### Changed
- Updated CLAUDE.md to document multi-scan review architecture: `session_scans` junction table, `Finding.get_by_scan_ids_merged()` query method, `ReviewContext` field count (15 fields), multi-scan session resume behavior, and multi-scan syntax in Common Commands

## [1.2.25] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- Multi-scan review mode: users can now select multiple scans at the review prompt using single numbers, ranges (e.g. `1-3`), or comma-separated lists (e.g. `1,3,5`); findings from all selected scans are presented in a merged, deduplicated view (`cerno.py`, `cerno_pkg/tui.py`)
- New `parse_scan_selection()` function in `tui.py` for parsing multi-scan index input (mirrors `parse_severity_selection()` pattern)
- New `Finding.get_by_scan_ids_merged()` classmethod in `models.py` for cross-scan plugin deduplication; returns one representative Finding per plugin_id and a dict of all instances across scans
- "Scans" column in finding list table showing `"All N"` or `"M of N"` scan coverage per plugin when reviewing multiple scans (`render.py:render_finding_list_table()`)
- Review state broadcasts across all selected scans: marking a finding as reviewed/completed/skipped updates that finding in ALL selected scans containing the same plugin (`cerno.py:browse_file_list()`)
- New `session_scans` junction table in SQLite schema for tracking which scans belong to a multi-scan session (`database.py`)
- Multi-scan session persistence: `save_session()` and `load_session()` in `session.py` now store and restore additional scan IDs via `session_scans` table
- New `scan_ids: list[int]` field on `ReviewContext` dataclass in `tool_context.py` for multi-scan context propagation

## [1.2.24] - 2026-02-05

### Added
- Service mapping during Nessus import: `svc_name` and `protocol` from ReportItem elements are now captured in a new `host_services` table, enabling per-host, per-port service identification (`database.py`, `nessus_import.py`)
- New `v_http_services` SQL view for querying HTTP/HTTPS services discovered per scan
- Nuclei tool suggestion after import: automatically generates `http_urls.txt` from discovered web services and suggests a `nuclei -list` command alongside EyeWitness/gowitness (`cerno.py`)
- Query helper `get_http_urls_for_scan()` in `models.py`

## [1.2.23] - 2026-01-28

### Changed
- Host display and tool target files now use original scan target (FQDN or IP) instead of resolved IP address, fixing tool failures on external network scans where Nessus target was an FQDN (`models.py: get_hosts_and_ports(), get_all_host_port_lines(), get_plugin_outputs_by_host()`)

## [1.2.22] - 2026-01-28

### Added
- Added module info prompt after Metasploit search completes - users can now paste a module path and run/copy `msfconsole info` command without leaving the TUI (tools.py)

### Fixed
- Fixed character encoding corruption in error messages (mojibake `â€"` replaced with proper em-dash `—`)
- Fixed `LOGURU_AVAILABLE` redefinition warning in logging_setup.py
- Added proper type annotation guard for `os.geteuid()` on Windows (ops.py)
- Fixed keyboard shortcut consistency: `[n]` → `[N]` in Metasploit command prompt (tools.py)
- Fixed all 28 mypy type errors across 11 files for clean static type checking
  - Added proper type annotations and casts for database row access
  - Fixed union type handling in nessus_import.py for CVE/MSF lists
  - Added explicit type annotations for complex data structures
  - Removed unreachable code paths detected by type checker
- Fixed incorrect command suggestion in scan delete error (`'cerno list'` → `'cerno scan list'`)
- Fixed hardcoded `[red]` Rich markup in mark-all warning to respect `no_color` config setting (tui.py)
- Fixed silent CVE extraction failures - now reports failure count and logs details (render.py)

### Changed
- Removed dead code: unused Metasploit web scraping imports (`requests`, `BeautifulSoup`) from tools.py
- Removed duplicate `print_action_menu()` function from tools.py (now imports from render.py)
- Added `types-PyYAML` to dev dependencies for better type checking
- Improved error messages with recovery suggestions for database and config failures
- Added Troubleshooting, Contributing, and Windows compatibility sections to README.md
- Improved finding review action menu with responsive layout that adapts to terminal width (render.py, fs.py)
- Improved tool action menus (nmap configuration, command review) with responsive layout (tools.py, render.py)

## [1.2.21] - 2026-01-22

### Added
- **Cross-scan comparison**: New `cerno scan compare <scan1> <scan2>` command to compare findings between two scans
  - Identifies new, resolved, and persistent vulnerabilities by comparing plugin presence
  - Tracks host changes: new hosts, removed hosts, persistent hosts
  - Summary panel with severity breakdown for each category
  - Optional `--severity` filter to focus on high/critical findings
- **Host vulnerability history**: New `cerno scan history <host_ip>` command to view vulnerability timeline for a specific host
  - Shows timeline of all scans where the host appeared
  - Displays severity breakdown per scan with trend indicators
  - Tracks finding count changes over time
- New SQL views for efficient cross-scan queries:
  - `v_scan_plugin_summary`: Plugin presence per scan with affected host/port counts
  - `v_host_scan_findings`: Per-host statistics broken down by scan
- New `cerno_pkg/cross_scan.py` module with data structures and analysis functions
- Composite index on `findings(scan_id, plugin_id)` for faster comparison queries

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Hosts table schema redesigned for FQDN-targeted external scans
  - New columns: `ip_address` (resolved IP), `scan_target` (what was scanned), `scan_target_type`, `netbios_name`, `fqdn`, `reverse_dns`
  - Composite unique constraint: `(ip_address, scan_target)` - enables load-balanced scenarios
  - Nessus import now parses `<HostProperties>` tags (host-ip, netbios-name, host-fqdn, host-rdns)
  - **Requires database deletion and re-import of scans** (`rm ~/.cerno/cerno.db`)
- Host queries now use `ip_address` instead of `host_address` throughout codebase

### Fixed
- Fixed host metadata capture for FQDN-targeted scans (previously lost resolved IP)
- `reverse_dns` column now properly populated from Nessus data (was always NULL before)
- Fixed `v_host_scan_findings` view severity counts - was counting junction table rows instead of distinct plugins per severity
- Fixed color bleeding in scan comparison tables by using `Text` objects instead of markup strings

### Documentation
- Updated `docs/DATABASE.md` with new hosts table schema and query examples
- Updated `schema.sql` with new hosts table structure and v_host_findings view
- Updated CLAUDE.md anti-pattern examples to use new column names

  - Special Filters section only appears when data exists (hidden when no Metasploit modules or workflow mappings)
  - Dynamic tip message reflects available options (e.g., "Use numbers (1-5), M, W, or combine")
  - Selection now accepts `M`, `W` letters alongside numbers (e.g., `1-3,M` or `M,W`)

## [1.2.19] - 2026-01-16

### Changed
- Enhanced NetExec per-host breakdown display (`[N]` action) with Rich formatting
